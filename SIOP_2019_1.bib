These norms are presented as actual values ({TES}) and also as square root values (√{TES}). Other data include partial error scores for red-green and blue-yellow axes discrimination., Conclusion: This study provides the most detailed set of normative data to date. The data are also in agreement with other reports of chromatic discrimination, showing that the performance in this task varies as a U-shape function with age, the best being achieved at 19 years of age.},

Data supporting this thesis were obtained through the use of 70 items from a vocabulary test given to 1000 college seniors. The items were divided into 10 subtests, which were then given to 10 different groups of students. The item-sample estimate of the mean was closer to the mean than were 7 of the 10 examinee-sample estimates. Lord acknowledges that the method assumes that performance on an item does not depend on the context in which it occurs. This assumption can not apply to speeded tests. Other information that is needed to determine the value of item-sampling is discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},
